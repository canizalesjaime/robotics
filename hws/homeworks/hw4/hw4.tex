\section{Design question}
Design a system using the publisher subscriber model , for the follow scenario - a robot displays a tennis ball in its visual field(camera) then navigates to the position of the tennis ball. Assume you are in a room where the only yellow object is the tennis ball.
\section{Programming question}
1. Use theconstructsim.com to develop a node that uses turtlesim to draw a hexagon with sides equal to 1. Do not hard code the points and instead try to use the geometric properties of the hexagon to draw the shape.\\
2. Given point ${}^AP_1= \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\1  \end{bmatrix}$ in the turtles frame, write a node that prints this point in the world frame(the map on simulator), run this node alongside part 1 of this question.
